# BaC

business as code is the logical follow-up to the Infra as Code, and moreover the [As_a_service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service) stuff.

## key motivations:

- decouple needed skills and competencies among whole business life-cycle for the sake of:
  - redundancy/reilability
  - ease of access to all variety thru the code hubs
  - time to market reduction & speedu of response to the changes 
  - at the end the survivability 
- provide and secure fair compensation to all contributors, based on:
  - amount of their contribution
  - frequency of their code usage

## examples:

- distributed and decentralized k8s workers, generally available:
  - is's like spot ec2 market in aws, but open-source and decentralized
  
- ideas hub:
  - someone commits his idea to the hub and thereby initialize [BaC](#BaC) project/repo
  - others interacts as:
    - dev/ops partners who actually drive the idea to running business
    - investors who exchange their funds for business shares
    - clients who consume the realization of idea:
      - and interact directly to business runners via the same hub by raising tickets/feature requests
      - there should be possibility to directly fund bug-fixing for example, speeding up thereby issue resolution
      
- DevOps records: 
  - an community based label releasing releases with the content generated by code
  - dnf as 01
  - apply your demo via pull request


- movies translation service:
  - someone requests translation of movie, and thereby creates crowd-funding compaign for the translation  
  - translators, who agree with the fee, from the raised money, contribute to the translation:
    - and getting paid based on the amount of their contrubution
    - and the frequency of translation plays
  - there needed the copyright clearance as service
  
## needed services

- patent as service
- profit-sharing platform as service
- legal support as service
- production as service
- operations as service
